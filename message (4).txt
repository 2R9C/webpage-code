    <h1 id="weapon-title">Weapon Overview</h1>

    <p id="description">Get to know all of the weapons in Valorant</p>




    <h1>Pistol</h1>
    <h3>Classic</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Classic is a pistol that does a relatively small amount of damage. 
        However, you get it for free when you spawn in the game, and it works well for rounds you want to save on.
        It has two modes of fire, each activated by left or right clicking. When you left click, it shoots one bullet, 
        and when you right click, it shoots out 3 bullets in a shotgun-like fashion. The alternate fire is useful for jump peeking
        or holding tight angles.</p>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/5/57/Classic.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20200404154125" alt="The Classic Pistol" class="weapon-images">


    
    <h3>Shorty</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Shorty is in the pistol category despite being a shotgun. For its 200 credit price, it is very 
        useful to hold angles. You can also use it along with Raze's satchels to fly around corners and get easy kills.
    </p>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/7/77/Shorty.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20200404154222" alt="The Shorty Pistol" class="weapon-images">

    <h3>Frenzy</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Frenzy is a fully automatic pistol that costs just 400 credits. If you don't want to bother with
        trying to be accurate, use this weapon to spray down enemies at close range. It is a viable option for save rounds along 
        with the Classic, but the recoil may be difficult to control at longer distances.
    </p>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/f/f1/Frenzy.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20200404154617" alt="The Frenzy Pistol"class="weapon-images">
    <h3>Ghost</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Ghost is a semi-automatic pistol that is mainly used for the amount of damage it does for the cost.
        On enemies with no shields, the Ghost will kill them with one shot to the head. If they have full shields, it only increases to two.
        The pistol's accuracy, damage, and reliability make it a useful pick for many situations, especially since it only costs 500 credits.
    </p>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/a/ab/Ghost.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20200404154731" alt="The Ghost Pistol"class="weapon-images">
    <h3>Sheriff</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Sheriff absolutely screams "I HAVE TOO MUCH CONFIDENCE!" Its ability to one shot kill fully armored 
        opponents with a shot to the head makes it the main weapon of anyone who thinks they can aim really well. In any other department besides one taps, it falls
        short due to its low accuracy and long pullout time. It could be a viable choice for economy rounds due to the damage output rivaling that
        of the main rifles as well as the price tag of 800 credits.
    </p>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/3/3e/Sheriff.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20200404154438" alt="The Sheriff Pistol" class="weapon-images">

    <h1>SMG</h1>

    <h3>Stinger</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Stinger is mostly used for its extremely high fire rate. It sits at a price point of 1000 credits, and is useful for 
        close to mid range engagements. The primary fire (left-click) will fire the 20 bullet magazine at a speeding 18 rounds per second. The alternate fire
        (right-click) will fire 3 bullets at a time in quick succession. This mode is usually used for longer ranges, since the high fire rate makes the recoil
        extremely difficult to control.
    </p>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/b/b6/Stinger.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20200404170849" alt="The Stinger SMG"class="weapon-images">
    <h3>Spectre</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Spectre is usually something you use when you have a worse weapon and you find this dropped on the ground.
        The 1,600 credit price point for this weapon is steep considering you could get a Ghost and a Stinger to better equip yourself for long and close range engagements.
        You could also purchase another ability with the 100 credits left over, depending on your agent. It really isn't a very good choice.
    </p>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/9/90/Spectre.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20200404170922" alt="The Spectre SMG"class="weapon-images">
    <h1>Rifle</h1>

    <h3>Bulldog</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Bulldog is the cheapest rifle in the bunch, and costs 2,100 credits. It can be used for force buy rounds
        since it costs more than most SMGs. It has two fire modes, similarly to the Stinger. The normal fire (left-click)
        gives you the full power of the weapon. It has a fire rate of 9.15 rounds per second. The alternate fire (right-click) 
        gives a similar difference from the normal mode to the Stinger's alt fire. It shoots out 3 bullets in a burst fashion.</p>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/0/07/Bulldog.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20200404171103" alt="The Bulldog Rifle" class="weapon-images">
    <h3>Guardian</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Guardian is like the Sheriff but with more upsides. It has the ability to one tap armored opponents similarly to the Sheriff, but costs
        2400 credits. At a quadruple-fold price increase, what changes? Well, it can one tap armored opponents at ANY RANGE. It has a low damage dropoff,
        and it has a 1.5x scope to help increase accuracy. It's a very useful weapon, but isn't used as much as the big two since they only cost a few hundred credits more.
    </p>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/f/fd/Guardian.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20200404171224" alt="The Guardian Rifle"class="weapon-images">

    <h3>Phantom</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Phantom is the counterpart to the Vandal in the rifle section. it is one of the two rifles that are most sought after in game.
        It does less damage per bullet, but makes up for it with its higher fire rate, higher magazine capacity, silencer, first shot accuracy, and lower spread. However, 
        it cannot one tap armored opponents, and damage drops off at long distances.</p>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/e/ec/Phantom.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20200404171302" alt="The Phantom Rifle"class="weapon-images">
    
    <h3>Vandal</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Vandal has a higher spread and recoil, but since the fire rate is slower, it can be easier to control. It sacrifices what the Phantom has
        for a damage model where 1 headshot will kill a fully armored opponent at any range. 4 body shots will kill, as well as 5 leg shots. It has a 1.25x scope that, combined
        with the nonexistent damage dropoff, is a greaat choice for long range battles, and can even rival the sniper rifles. </p>

        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/5/56/Vandal.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20200404171348" alt="The Vandal Rifle" class="weapon-images">

    <h1>Shotgun</h1>
    <h3>Bucky</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Bucky is a cheap shotgun that is honestly overpowered. It costs 900 credits, and has 2 fire modes. The primary fire (left-click) 
        fires 15 pellets with high falloff. The alternate fire (right-click) shoots a single shell which has 8 pellets and explodes at 8 meters. If the shell hits an enemy 
        closer than 8 meters, it will only do 1 point of damage.The primary fire is basically useless at range, but you can extend it with the alternate fire. At 8 or fewer meters,
         7 or more pellets are necessary to kill. At 8 to 12 meters, 9 are needed. It's really useful in coordination with Raze's satchels or a creative Sage wall.
    </p>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/e/eb/Bucky.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/349?cb=20200404171832" alt="The Bucky Shotgun" class="weapon-images">

    <h3>Judge</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Judge is an automatic shotgun that does less damage than the Bucky but has a reduced spread and significantly higher fire 
        rate. It shoots 12 bullets at a time, and 9 bullets are needed to oneshot and armored opponent.
        All 12 are needed at 10-15 meters if they strike the body. If a bullet hits the head, it deals double damage.
    </p>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/8/8a/Judge.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20200404171858" alt="The Judge Shotgun"class="weapon-images">

    <h1>Heavy</h1>
    <h3>Ares</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Ares is the cheaper of the two heavy weapons. It costs 1600 credits, the same as the Spectre, and is suitable for a more 
        passive playstyle. Its high wall penetration makes it useful for really cheesy plays where you spam down an angle. It is a light machine gun with a very large ammo capacity.
    </p>

    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/0/05/Ares.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20200404171957" alt="The Ares Heavy Weapon"class="weapon-images">

    <h3>Odin</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">Also known as the "UGH I MISCLICKED", the Odin is usually what you buy on the last round of a match just to anger your opponents
        and shove your ego in their face. It costs 3200 credits and using the primary fire, the firerate increases over time. If you use the 1.25x scope, you get higher accuracy 
        and the ability to immediately start shooting at the maximum firerate, or 15.6 rounds per second.
    </p>

    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/5/58/Odin.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/349?cb=20200404172022" alt="The Odin Heavy Weapon"class="weapon-images">
    
    <h1>Sniper</h1>
    
    <h3>Marshal</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">
        The Marshal is the cheaper counterpart of the Operator. You can move very quickly with it and it has a high damage per bullet.
        The cost is 1100 credits. It has a quick scoping animation and very good noscoping accuracy.
        This is useful for peeking an angle very quickly and chipping away at the health of enemies. It takes one shot to the head to 
        kill, while two to the body kills against opponents with heavy armor. The cost makes it very efficient to use in a forcebuy.
    </p>

    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/b/b9/Marshal.png/revision/latest?cb=20200404172126" alt="The Marshal Sniper"class="weapon-images">
    
    <h3>Operator</h3>
    <p class="weapon-overview-paragraph">The Operator is the most expensive weapon and sniper, at 5000 credits. Its oneshot ability is what makes it a very strong weapon, completely shutting off 
        any long-range pushes, and having pinpoint accuracy. The scope has a dual zoom mode where you can choose to use 2.5x zoom or 5x zoom.
        However, it has a very low fire rate and noscoping accuracy, which makes it very difficult to use at close range. Most people would just take out their pistol if in a close range battle. 
    </p>
